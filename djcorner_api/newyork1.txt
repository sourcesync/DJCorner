<p class="p1">
 <strong>ITALOBOYZ</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Since arriving in London at the beginning of the new millennium, Italoboyz, aka Marco Donato and Federico Marton, have become an essential fixture of the capital&rsquo;s small but passionate house/techno/minimal scene. From their notorious back-to-back DJ sets at FESH (333, London), their reputation has grown to the point where they can now be found playing regularly across the planet. However, it&rsquo;s not just the energy and flair of their DJ sets that has captured the imagination, Italoboyz releases now on some of today&rsquo;s most influential minimal-house / techno labels like Mothership and Get Physical, after starting to work in 2005/2006 with label like Treibstoff, Einmaleins Musik, Gumption and Safari Electronique. &ldquo;When you realize that without moving there won&rsquo;t be any change, you move&hellip;&rdquo; explains Marco, so that&rsquo;s exactly what they did, swapping their native Italy for London (Marco in 2001 and Fede in 2002), urged on by separate desires to go deeper and get more involved in electronic music. It was this fusion of minds, with complementary ways of both absorbing and communicating electronic music that inspired them to team up and form Italoboyz in 2002. Since then they haven&rsquo;t stopped moving forward, obsessively exploring the hybrid sounds of house and techno through their love of minimalism, acid-house and hi-tech funk. Although their sound has always been characterized by organic elements along with large doses of funk and energy, the distinctive flavor of their productions and DJ sets is down to a willingness to embrace and explore the various genres and sub-genres that develop out of this constantly evolving music. One of the reasons Italoboyz productions are so well received is the fact that their musical expression is a fusion of sounds, themes and ideas resulting from over 15 years of music research and DJing experience. Their aim is to deliver the most modern, cutting edge sound possible but it should still resonate through time, both past and future, in order to make the immediate experience all the more seductive. When they were throwing their own parties in 2003/2004 they built up quite a following, often running all day long from Sunday afternoon till early Monday morning. It&rsquo;s an experience that has given them valuable knowledge and insight</strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>JAMMA</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>From day one, Jamma (dj &amp; promoter) was surrounded by music whether it be his Fisher-price Tin Music Box influence at the age of 5&hellip;or in his later years with the drum &amp; bass sound in the mid to later nineties. A love for music in all its forms and diversity, music has always been an integral part of his life. Jamma discovered the world of techno through several parties around London. Having spent the first 6 years with Hertzquake Crew rinsing the drum &amp; bass culture that Italy and Milan had to offer, managing several parties with main guests such as Hype, Dillinja, Pendulum to name few, he connected with the techno sound. He moved to London and created Maximize, a weekly techno-minimal gig. Later hooked up with Julius which in turn led to the crew of Bread&amp;Butter. </strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>GABRIEL AMARU</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the music and it&rsquo;s always been that way...&rdquo; he says as laidback and as playful as he&rsquo;s always been. Born out of a world of contradictions, Gabriel amaru has always found a way to be musical. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Starting from hard house and then sinking into techno, and later into house, Gabriel amaru&rsquo;s sound today is a funky breed of techno and house music, always with a strong bass line.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>&ldquo;I can say I&#39;m not gonna get stuck here and I&#39;m already playing with more experimental, sometimes even strange sounds in techno. And again I won&rsquo;t stop there, I don&#39;t feel think I should get stuck in a certain genre, I feel I&rsquo;ll always want to explore and refresh.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>JOHNNY FIORE</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Johnny Fiore, born in Avellino, Italy in &rsquo;84, started playing bass at the age of 13 in local metal bands. His passion for music took him to Turin, North Italy, at the age of 18, known as the cultural centre for the arts; &lsquo;the Italian Detroit&rsquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Turin is where his mind was opened to all different genres and where his DJ career began playing Nu Jazz and Broken Beats, which lead to a love of techno as a clubber and the birth of DJ JP Della Camera.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>2010 saw the need for change and London became the place to be. London inspired JP Della Camera to evolve his sound (and name) and so was born house music DJ, Johnny Fiore.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Johnny&rsquo;s sound draws inspiration from his many musical interests including soul, funky, electro beats, which shows in his set, full of new, deep and old school house and techno. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Currently a regular at the Egg, Johnny Fiore is now also Label Manager of Mind Ability Records&rsquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>THOMAS JAMES</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Thomas James&rsquo; musical journey since an early age has taken him through punk, metal, hip-hop, breakbeats, funk, soul and electronica. Analogue cassette tapes, fanzines and the whole DIY aspect of music scenes has always been a strong interest to him. He then started to become inspired by more contemporary electronic styles of music. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>He began to buy more vinyl and decided to start DJing from his growing interest in house and techno. Artists and DJ&#39;s such as Steve Bug, Ricardo Villalobos, Andrew Weatherall and Craig Richards all added to his inspiration. Encouragement from friends gave him the drive to quickly gain his mixing skills and form his own style. A vinyl purist, Thomas James&#39; sets currently weave between disco, deep house and techno.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>He has played various venues and parties around the southeast as well as co-promoting and designing the &#39;unwanted&#39; brand. Already the &lsquo;unwanted&rsquo; parties have gained a strong following where Thomas James has helped book and play alongside the likes of A.Skillz, Casper C, Mr Cosmo, Tayo, Lone and Jazz-T. He now wants to take the &lsquo;unwanted&rsquo; brand, his DJing and promotion further by introducing it to other cities in the UK and beyond.</strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>CHRIS GEE</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Dig into Chris Gee&#39;s record box and you will find a collection of Hip Hop, broken dubstep, jazzed out garage and funk fused beats. Being able to drop big rhythm is something he loves. Deep House and Nu-disco is the sound Chris is bringing to the floor much more these days. Deep punchy warm kicks, nothing less he would say. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>He runs a night called &#39;unwanted&#39; in Guildford along with a tight family of DJs Thomas James/ +MORE/ Venom/ A.M.T/ Gember.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>In his first year of running unwanted he has put on acts such as A.Skillz, Casper C, Mr Cosmo, Tayo, Lone, Jazz-T and Carlotek. 2011 brings a new and bigger venue along with more exciting artists and plans of expansion to neighboring cites. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>For the last two years throughout the summer he has been running an all-day-into-the-night Roots &amp; Culture jam, which from this has made him more friends with in reggae and dub. Playing alongside the likes of The Roots brothers, Dub Pistols, Earl Gateshead (Trojan), Subsource, Reggae Roast, Instruments of Jah and Count Skylarkin at One Love festival, Reggae Rooms, Guildfest and The Boileroom.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>He loves nothing more then to be playing wax 180gm heavy!</strong></p>

<p><em><strong>IT&rsquo;S ON! Avicii&rsquo;s biggest show to date &ndash; New Year&rsquo;s Eve &ndash; New York City</strong><br />
 <br />
 Pre-sale has commenced for what will be, hands down, the most sensational farewell to 2011 New York City has to offer. After much hearsay, it can now be revealed that on 31<sup>st</sup> December, Swedish born hit maker AVICII will grace one of the most stunning and exclusive venues in Manhattan &ndash; <strong>PIER 94</strong> &ndash; for a New Year&rsquo;s send off like none other.</em></p>
<p><em>The insane venue, which until today has been kept a closely guarded secret, is seldom used for such events, so this really is a <strong>ONCE IN A LIFETIME</strong> opportunity! Needless to say that the production, design and surprises going into this one off show &ndash; masterminded by <strong>Ash</strong> (<strong>At Night Management</strong>) and partners <strong>Pacha</strong> &ndash; will be extraordinary. It&rsquo;s got all the ingredients&hellip;why on earth wouldn&rsquo;t you go!</em></p>
<p><em>The last time Ash teamed up with Pacha NYC, it <strong>COMPLETELY SOLD OUT</strong>. The 4000 people that were quick enough out the blocks witnessed the then 21-year-old set Governor&rsquo;s Island alight in a night to remember. So when the man behind &lsquo;Seek Bromance&rsquo;, &lsquo;Fade into Darkness&rsquo; and of course &lsquo;Levels&rsquo;, returns at the end of December to set the tone for 2012, you can bet your bottom dollar it&rsquo;ll be more elaborate in every way imaginable.</em></p>]]></description>

                <lineup contentType="text/html"><![CDATA[<p>Damian Lazarus + Clive Henry + Art Department</p>
<p>Descrivere in poche parole la carriera di <strong>Damian Lazarus</strong>, mostro sacro della scena clubbing mondiale, &egrave; impresa titanica. Editore del magazine Dazed and Confused, a capo dell&rsquo;etichetta City Rockers, la stessa di Tiga e Felix Da Housecat, e infine creatore nel 2004 della label culto &ldquo;Crosstown Rebels&rdquo; (che vede tra gli altri nella propria scuderia Jamie Jones, Phonique, Seth Troxler ecc). La sua missione &egrave; quella di spazzare via la mediocrit&agrave;, l&rsquo;obsoleto per ricercare sempre novit&agrave; ed energia. Il suo ultimo lavoro, l&rsquo;album &ldquo;Smoke the monster out&rdquo;, uscito per Get Physical, ha gi&agrave; lasciato un segno indelebile nel panorama dance mondiale. Con i suoi live ha girato tutto il mondo, approdando al DC10 di Ibiza, al Fabric di Londra, alla WMC di Miami. Tutti i podcast dell&rsquo;artista sono disponibili su lazpod.com.</p>
<p>Membro del duo Peace Division, <strong>Clive Henry</strong> &egrave; una delle colonne portanti della scena techno/house UK. Entrato nella famiglia Circoloco@DC10 dall&rsquo;alba dei tempi, &egrave; senza dubbio uno dei resident pi&ugrave; rappresentativi della Crosstown Rebels. Cresciuti con sonorit&agrave; hip-hop, electro e 80&rsquo;s synth pop, i Peace Division hanno aiutato la diffusione mondiale dell&rsquo;house music. I tratti tipici del suono, tamburi tribali sfumature dark e un groove dub, sono diventati un importante biglietto da visita per molti remix, tra i quali Moby con &ldquo;Natural Blues&rdquo; e David Byrne con &ldquo;Lazy&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Art Department</strong> &egrave; il progetto nato dalla collaborazione tra Kenny Glasgow, il celebre producer canadese sulla cresta dell&rsquo;onda sin dalla fine degli anni 80, e Johnny White, nuova stella nascente del circuito underground Nordamericano. Il progetto parte nel 2009, quando Damian Lazarus chiede ai due amici di remixare un suo brano, Riz MC, per CrossTown Rebels; i due si trovano a lavorare insieme per la prima volta nonostante si conoscano gi&agrave; da un decennio. E&rsquo; l&rsquo; inizio di un nuovo sound, la presa di coscienza di aver trovato un filone musicale d&rsquo;oro che porter&agrave; i due dj a fondare Art Department. Da quel momento il sodalizio artistico continua a generare tracce ricercate e deep, in bilico tra sperimentazione di nuovi suoni e contrappunti housy e groovy magnificamente rievocati dalla sublime e inimitabile voce di Kenny. I loro live ai festival al W.M.C di Miami e a Detroit sono entrati nella leggenda lasciando i presenti senza parole. Grazie a collaborazioni in vista con Soulclap, James Jones, Seth Troxler e un album uscito per la Crosstown Rebels di Lazarus, il 2011 pu&ograve; essere definito come l&rsquo;anno della definitiva consacrazione per gli Art department.</p>

Make your way to one of our four dance floors where you can dance the night away to music both old and new from House to Funky Vocal Electro and Disco to Club Classics.

 In true secret agent style, try your luck at a hand of Black Jack or a Game of Roulette in our very own Casino Royal, where you can bluff your way into the New Year, swap glances with impeccably groomed enemy agents at the table and sip champagne. All this glitz and glamour is likely to go to your head and if previous years are anything to go by, the night will have become part of a New Year&rsquo;s legend by the time the Midnight PA counts in to 2012!</div>

 On 31st December 2011 Revolution, America Square will transform into a New York paradise with famous landmarks and themed props throughout the venue. Staff will dress as local residents including NYPD officers, NY Yankee pitchers and a host of other costumes. There is a fantastic cheerleading display arranged with pom pom&#39;s and beautiful performers to toast the New Year.</p>

 Situated in the iconic America Square building, this stunning vodka cocktail bar can hold over 700 guests across its two rooms! Set beneath the arches of Fenchurch Street Station, Revolution mixes opulent Manhattan design with a twist of Soviet spirit. Each of the two arches has its own unique feeling, from the intimate speakeasy arch that harks back to the days of Prohibition and Moonshine to the imposing entrance arch mixing contemporary design and comfort.</p>

                <description contentType="text/html"><![CDATA[<p>Headlining is one of the true originators of techno music, a man as Detroit as they come and one of the Belleville Three: Mr Juan Atkins. Releasing music under his own name as well behind the aliases Cybotron, Model 500 and Infiniti, Juan is responsible for producing many of the timeless Detroit classics that we still love today and that have inspired millions. Djing for 30 years he has developed a knowledge of the that few can match. A LOST veteran, we look forward to have Juan throwing it down for us!</p>
<br />
<p>Chris Carrier from France. Chris played for Holic as part of their Robsoul Records showcase and more than impressed. With over 100 production credits under his belt, he&rsquo;s been an underground icon for the past decade. Never chasing the limelight, almost darting around it in all manner of guises and musical styles, Carrier is nevertheless revered today as one of the most prolific and gifted producers on the dance scene today. With 2011 being one of his busiest years for DJ gigs it seems we aren&rsquo;t the only one&rsquo;s he has been impressing.</p>
<br />

Producing under the moniker LOST for Perfecto and Mute Steve went on to establish Cosmic Records and subsidiaries Clubtracks, Lost Recording and ID, giving voice to productions from producers such as Luke Slater, DJ Rush, Tyree Cooper, DJ Funk,Jay Denham and many more. Lost recording being indicative of the seminal LOST sound. Such was Steve&rsquo;s vision that Lost was first to book latterday luminaries such as Jeff Mills, Richie Hawtin, Dan Bell and Robert Hood. As a truly international DJ, Steve has traveled the world with his unique representation of Acid House, Chicago House, Techno and for more experimental spacebase sets a firm grasp of everything from reggae, to italo, to broken beat.</p>
