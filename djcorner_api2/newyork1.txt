<p class="p1"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>ITALOBOYZ</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Since arriving in London at the beginning of the new millennium, Italoboyz, aka Marco Donato and Federico Marton, have become an essential fixture of the capital&rsquo;s small but passionate house/techno/minimal scene. From their notorious back-to-back DJ sets at FESH (333, London), their reputation has grown to the point where they can now be found playing regularly across the planet. However, it&rsquo;s not just the energy and flair of their DJ sets that has captured the imagination, Italoboyz releases now on some of today&rsquo;s most influential minimal-house / techno labels like Mothership and Get Physical, after starting to work in 2005/2006 with label like Treibstoff, Einmaleins Musik, Gumption and Safari Electronique. &ldquo;When you realize that without moving there won&rsquo;t be any change, you move&hellip;&rdquo; explains Marco, so that&rsquo;s exactly what they did, swapping their native Italy for London (Marco in 2001 and Fede in 2002), urged on by separate desires to go deeper and get more involved in electronic music. It was this fusion of minds, with complementary ways of both absorbing and communicating electronic music that inspired them to team up and form Italoboyz in 2002. Since then they haven&rsquo;t stopped moving forward, obsessively exploring the hybrid sounds of house and techno through their love of minimalism, acid-house and hi-tech funk. Although their sound has always been characterized by organic elements along with large doses of funk and energy, the distinctive flavor of their productions and DJ sets is down to a willingness to embrace and explore the various genres and sub-genres that develop out of this constantly evolving music. One of the reasons Italoboyz productions are so well received is the fact that their musical expression is a fusion of sounds, themes and ideas resulting from over 15 years of music research and DJing experience. Their aim is to deliver the most modern, cutting edge sound possible but it should still resonate through time, both past and future, in order to make the immediate experience all the more seductive. When they were throwing their own parties in 2003/2004 they built up quite a following, often running all day long from Sunday afternoon till early Monday morning. It&rsquo;s an experience that has given them valuable knowledge and insight</strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>JAMMA</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>From day one, Jamma (dj &amp; promoter) was surrounded by music whether it be his Fisher-price Tin Music Box influence at the age of 5&hellip;or in his later years with the drum &amp; bass sound in the mid to later nineties. A love for music in all its forms and diversity, music has always been an integral part of his life. Jamma discovered the world of techno through several parties around London. Having spent the first 6 years with Hertzquake Crew rinsing the drum &amp; bass culture that Italy and Milan had to offer, managing several parties with main guests such as Hype, Dillinja, Pendulum to name few, he connected with the techno sound. He moved to London and created Maximize, a weekly techno-minimal gig. Later hooked up with Julius which in turn led to the crew of Bread&amp;Butter. </strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>GABRIEL AMARU</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about the music and it&rsquo;s always been that way...&rdquo; he says as laidback and as playful as he&rsquo;s always been. Born out of a world of contradictions, Gabriel amaru has always found a way to be musical. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Starting from hard house and then sinking into techno, and later into house, Gabriel amaru&rsquo;s sound today is a funky breed of techno and house music, always with a strong bass line.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>&ldquo;I can say I&#39;m not gonna get stuck here and I&#39;m already playing with more experimental, sometimes even strange sounds in techno. And again I won&rsquo;t stop there, I don&#39;t feel think I should get stuck in a certain genre, I feel I&rsquo;ll always want to explore and refresh.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>JOHNNY FIORE</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Johnny Fiore, born in Avellino, Italy in &rsquo;84, started playing bass at the age of 13 in local metal bands. His passion for music took him to Turin, North Italy, at the age of 18, known as the cultural centre for the arts; &lsquo;the Italian Detroit&rsquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Turin is where his mind was opened to all different genres and where his DJ career began playing Nu Jazz and Broken Beats, which lead to a love of techno as a clubber and the birth of DJ JP Della Camera.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>2010 saw the need for change and London became the place to be. London inspired JP Della Camera to evolve his sound (and name) and so was born house music DJ, Johnny Fiore.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Johnny&rsquo;s sound draws inspiration from his many musical interests including soul, funky, electro beats, which shows in his set, full of new, deep and old school house and techno. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Currently a regular at the Egg, Johnny Fiore is now also Label Manager of Mind Ability Records&rsquo;.</strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>THOMAS JAMES</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Thomas James&rsquo; musical journey since an early age has taken him through punk, metal, hip-hop, breakbeats, funk, soul and electronica. Analogue cassette tapes, fanzines and the whole DIY aspect of music scenes has always been a strong interest to him. He then started to become inspired by more contemporary electronic styles of music. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>He began to buy more vinyl and decided to start DJing from his growing interest in house and techno. Artists and DJ&#39;s such as Steve Bug, Ricardo Villalobos, Andrew Weatherall and Craig Richards all added to his inspiration. Encouragement from friends gave him the drive to quickly gain his mixing skills and form his own style. A vinyl purist, Thomas James&#39; sets currently weave between disco, deep house and techno.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>He has played various venues and parties around the southeast as well as co-promoting and designing the &#39;unwanted&#39; brand. Already the &lsquo;unwanted&rsquo; parties have gained a strong following where Thomas James has helped book and play alongside the likes of A.Skillz, Casper C, Mr Cosmo, Tayo, Lone and Jazz-T. He now wants to take the &lsquo;unwanted&rsquo; brand, his DJing and promotion further by introducing it to other cities in the UK and beyond.</strong></p>
<p class="p2"></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>CHRIS GEE</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>Dig into Chris Gee&#39;s record box and you will find a collection of Hip Hop, broken dubstep, jazzed out garage and funk fused beats. Being able to drop big rhythm is something he loves. Deep House and Nu-disco is the sound Chris is bringing to the floor much more these days. Deep punchy warm kicks, nothing less he would say. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>He runs a night called &#39;unwanted&#39; in Guildford along with a tight family of DJs Thomas James/ +MORE/ Venom/ A.M.T/ Gember.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>In his first year of running unwanted he has put on acts such as A.Skillz, Casper C, Mr Cosmo, Tayo, Lone, Jazz-T and Carlotek. 2011 brings a new and bigger venue along with more exciting artists and plans of expansion to neighboring cites. </strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>For the last two years throughout the summer he has been running an all-day-into-the-night Roots &amp; Culture jam, which from this has made him more friends with in reggae and dub. Playing alongside the likes of The Roots brothers, Dub Pistols, Earl Gateshead (Trojan), Subsource, Reggae Roast, Instruments of Jah and Count Skylarkin at One Love festival, Reggae Rooms, Guildfest and The Boileroom.</strong></p>
<p class="p1">
 <strong>He loves nothing more then to be playing wax 180gm heavy!</strong></p>

 Codekontrol are back at Egg once again for another installment of our Technicolour series... this time its number 5 (V).<brlucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; text-align: left; " />
 <brlucida grande', tahoma, verdana, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 11px; line-height: 14px; text-align: left; " />
 The increase in demand for this now established night has forced our hand to bring you yet more Codekontrol flavour, but this time with a twist!!<br />
 <br />
 Tech-house is still the name of the game for all you Codekontrol regulars and you already know what to expect from our superb resident Soundbyte. But have we got a treat in store for you..!!<br />
 <br />
 Namito is taking the world by storm at the moment, and we have been lucky enough (or you have been lucky enough) to secure another set from him. We personally cannot wait for this, because, as always, Namito&#39;s sets seem to just get better and better every time he plays for us. Add into the mix Antonio Vinciguerra from House Republic and the Decksavers crew consisting of Deegan and Jack Brazzo, then add Oli_N from Release Sustain... you have a main course fit for any king, let alone a single nightclub on 1 night.<br />
 <br />
 However... if you like to fine dine in the terrace, then yet again we have some exquisite flavours for you all to sample. Drum &amp; Bass, Dubstep and Breakbeat is the name of the game here...!! What an incredible line up (if i dont mind saying so myself (JM)). Hailing from across the UK and beyond we have some of the finest DJs that you could possibly shake a pointy stick at!! I believe the line-up speaks for itself and needs no real further input from me on that score ;).<br />
 <br />
 So what are you waiting for?? We suggest that you get you tickets early for this one, as we are anticipating a sell-out night. Look out for the ticketing links and promotions on various pages on Facebook, Twitter, Resident Advisor and all the usual online ticket outlets. <br />

<p><em><strong>IT&rsquo;S ON! Avicii&rsquo;s biggest show to date &ndash; New Year&rsquo;s Eve &ndash; New York City</strong><br />
 <br />
 Pre-sale has commenced for what will be, hands down, the most sensational farewell to 2011 New York City has to offer. After much hearsay, it can now be revealed that on 31<sup>st</sup> December, Swedish born hit maker AVICII will grace one of the most stunning and exclusive venues in Manhattan &ndash; <strong>PIER 94</strong> &ndash; for a New Year&rsquo;s send off like none other.</em></p>
<p><em>The insane venue, which until today has been kept a closely guarded secret, is seldom used for such events, so this really is a <strong>ONCE IN A LIFETIME</strong> opportunity! Needless to say that the production, design and surprises going into this one off show &ndash; masterminded by <strong>Ash</strong> (<strong>At Night Management</strong>) and partners <strong>Pacha</strong> &ndash; will be extraordinary. It&rsquo;s got all the ingredients&hellip;why on earth wouldn&rsquo;t you go!</em></p>
<p><em>The last time Ash teamed up with Pacha NYC, it <strong>COMPLETELY SOLD OUT</strong>. The 4000 people that were quick enough out the blocks witnessed the then 21-year-old set Governor&rsquo;s Island alight in a night to remember. So when the man behind &lsquo;Seek Bromance&rsquo;, &lsquo;Fade into Darkness&rsquo; and of course &lsquo;Levels&rsquo;, returns at the end of December to set the tone for 2012, you can bet your bottom dollar it&rsquo;ll be more elaborate in every way imaginable.</em></p>]]></description>

                <description contentType="text/html"><![CDATA[<p>This legendary dance club music venue which has a 900 plus-person-capacity space distinguishes itself from the rest of New York City&rsquo;s giants with exposed beams, lounge-worthy lighting, and a column-free main floor with a great and unobstructed line of sight whether you are in the upstairs VIP only mezzanine or the main dance floor.</p>
<p>Celebrate this <strong>New Years Eve</strong> at one of NYC&rsquo;s true hidden gems right in the heart of the city&rsquo;s infamous meatpacking district. Bookings are consciously eclectic, but overall reflect the evolved vibe of the neighborhood with bling- and controversy-free hip-hop acts, mellow song-stresses, and veteran critical darlings, such as 50 cents, Amy Winehouse, Santana, Jay-Z and Stevie Wonder to name a few. In Short, there is no better venue to ring in the new year in new york city than club Highline Ballroom. Whether you are looking to dance the night away or lounge out in the private VIP sections, Highline has it all and we cordially invite you to celebrate this New Years Eve at this intimate space that allows patrons to feel like they&#39;re in the front row, even when they&#39;re stuck in the back. The minimalist, industrial feel of Highline Ballroom certainly adds a taste of the true essence of downtown New York&#39;s famed meatpacking district.</p>

<p>Descrivere in poche parole la carriera di <strong>Damian Lazarus</strong>, mostro sacro della scena clubbing mondiale, &egrave; impresa titanica. Editore del magazine Dazed and Confused, a capo dell&rsquo;etichetta City Rockers, la stessa di Tiga e Felix Da Housecat, e infine creatore nel 2004 della label culto &ldquo;Crosstown Rebels&rdquo; (che vede tra gli altri nella propria scuderia Jamie Jones, Phonique, Seth Troxler ecc). La sua missione &egrave; quella di spazzare via la mediocrit&agrave;, l&rsquo;obsoleto per ricercare sempre novit&agrave; ed energia. Il suo ultimo lavoro, l&rsquo;album &ldquo;Smoke the monster out&rdquo;, uscito per Get Physical, ha gi&agrave; lasciato un segno indelebile nel panorama dance mondiale. Con i suoi live ha girato tutto il mondo, approdando al DC10 di Ibiza, al Fabric di Londra, alla WMC di Miami. Tutti i podcast dell&rsquo;artista sono disponibili su lazpod.com.</p>
<p>Membro del duo Peace Division, <strong>Clive Henry</strong> &egrave; una delle colonne portanti della scena techno/house UK. Entrato nella famiglia Circoloco@DC10 dall&rsquo;alba dei tempi, &egrave; senza dubbio uno dei resident pi&ugrave; rappresentativi della Crosstown Rebels. Cresciuti con sonorit&agrave; hip-hop, electro e 80&rsquo;s synth pop, i Peace Division hanno aiutato la diffusione mondiale dell&rsquo;house music. I tratti tipici del suono, tamburi tribali sfumature dark e un groove dub, sono diventati un importante biglietto da visita per molti remix, tra i quali Moby con &ldquo;Natural Blues&rdquo; e David Byrne con &ldquo;Lazy&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Art Department</strong> &egrave; il progetto nato dalla collaborazione tra Kenny Glasgow, il celebre producer canadese sulla cresta dell&rsquo;onda sin dalla fine degli anni 80, e Johnny White, nuova stella nascente del circuito underground Nordamericano. Il progetto parte nel 2009, quando Damian Lazarus chiede ai due amici di remixare un suo brano, Riz MC, per CrossTown Rebels; i due si trovano a lavorare insieme per la prima volta nonostante si conoscano gi&agrave; da un decennio. E&rsquo; l&rsquo; inizio di un nuovo sound, la presa di coscienza di aver trovato un filone musicale d&rsquo;oro che porter&agrave; i due dj a fondare Art Department. Da quel momento il sodalizio artistico continua a generare tracce ricercate e deep, in bilico tra sperimentazione di nuovi suoni e contrappunti housy e groovy magnificamente rievocati dalla sublime e inimitabile voce di Kenny. I loro live ai festival al W.M.C di Miami e a Detroit sono entrati nella leggenda lasciando i presenti senza parole. Grazie a collaborazioni in vista con Soulclap, James Jones, Seth Troxler e un album uscito per la Crosstown Rebels di Lazarus, il 2011 pu&ograve; essere definito come l&rsquo;anno della definitiva consacrazione per gli Art department.</p>
